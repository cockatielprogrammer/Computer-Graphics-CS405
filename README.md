# Computer-Graphics-CS405
Projects and Mini Projects for Computer Graphics lesson such as Data Visualization


This is a data visualization assignment for CS405 Computer Graphics lesson in SabancÄ± University in Fall 2023.

In this assignment, I have selected the TUIK data subject as 5 year under death numbers between the years 2009 and 2022 In the HTML folder, I have used rect (rectangle) and line for barcharts while visualizing the data.
In order to form a graph that consists of 1 horitontal line to represent x axis, and 2 vertical lines to represent y axis on the basis of years, number of 5 year below deaths and the death rates in terms of thousands. 
Furthermore, I have used texts in order to write the topic, the numbers and other informations such as header and numeric informations. 
Moreover, I have used circle for using points and polyline for representing the the death speed.  
In the CSS file, I have adjusted the barchart color.  At the beginning visualization process was forming charts.
I have determined their y axis according to the amounts in years and increased the height accordingly. So that the differences of heights have been adjusted accurately.
After finishing visualizing the charts and the graph, I have lines with colors blue and red respectively, to represent death numbers and the speed.
Then I have used circle and put a dot in the middle of red line, as it was used in TUIK website. I have used the same method while forming dots in the polyline in particular regions. (above the charts of years 2009, 2016, 2021 and 2022.
